[CryptoKitties](http://cryptokitties.co) is one of the most popular distributed apps on the Ethereum Network. It's a game that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell various types of virtual cats.

To be able to run CryptoKitties on your browser you'll need to install [Metamask](http://metamask.io/) or use a dedicated Ethereum browser like Mist or Parity.

For this challenge you will create a simple UI that will be able to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain, using web3.js and the [drizzle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/drizzle/getting-started) library. This UI will allow the user to type in a CryptoKitty's ID, and will display information about that Kitty.
